What causes the murderous thinking described here?_ {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Chapter 12 covers the phenomenon of millenarianism (apocalyptic thinking) in other religions--Judaism, Buddhism, and Christianity.

Of these 40 conflicts, 11 have seen at least 1000 battle deaths and thus rise to the level or "wars," using the common definition. Conflicts are fewer than the post-1945 peak year of 1991 (when 51 conflicts were ongoing), but more than the trough year of 2010, (31 ongoing) and far more than 1946 (17 ongoing). Annual battle deaths reached a post-Cold War peak in 2014 at 101,400, due largely to the great violence of the Syrian civil war. However, fatalities are still lower than during the second half of the last century, which saw great bloodletting in several episodes (the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Angola, Iran-Iraq, Congo, and Ethiopia-Eritrea)._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}} _Nearly all conflicts today are civil conflicts--in fact only one "international" conflict was underway in 2014 (India-Pakistan). This is a huge change from the centuries before 1945, when most war was between states. But many civil wars today are "internationalized"-- troops from foreign states are involved--so they are fueled by international conflict even though they occur within one state. Thirteen of the 39 internal conflicts ongoing in 2014 were "internationalized," an all time high. These thirteen include the conflicts in Congo, Ukraine, Yemen, Iraq, Somalia, South Sudan, and Afghanistan. Yet interstate war has undeniable abated. Why has this happened? Could interstate war make a comeback? Many worry about scenarios involving Korea, Iran, and U.S.-China._ {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
